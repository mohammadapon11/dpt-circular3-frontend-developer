## Time Spent

I spent a total of 10-11 hours to complete this website.

## Best Practices Followed

### Modularity

- Components are modular and reusable, promoting code maintainability and scalability.
- Separation of concerns is maintained, with each component responsible for a specific task.

### Performance Optimization

- Utilized React.memo and PureComponent to optimize rendering and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Employed lazy loading and code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense for better performance and faster load times.

### State Management

- Leveraged React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks for managing component state and side effects.

### Accessibility

- Implemented semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and screen reader support.
- Ensured proper use of ARIA attributes and labels for interactive elements.

### Code Quality

- Followed consistent coding conventions and naming conventions throughout the codebase.
- Utilized ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting to maintain code quality and consistency.

### Additional Best Practices

#### Better Code Formatting

- Ensure your code is well-organized and follows industry-standard formatting conventions.

#### Variable Naming

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables to enhance code readability.

#### Function Naming

- Employ clear and concise naming conventions for functions to convey their purpose.

#### Shorter Code

- Strive for succinct and efficient solutions without sacrificing clarity.

#### Modular Code

- Break down your code into modular components for better maintainability and reusability.

#### Component-based Code

- Utilize a component-based approach to structuring your code for scalability and maintainability.

#### Commenting

- Provide clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or functionality.

#### Error Handling

- Implement robust error handling mechanisms to ensure the stability of your code.

#### Code Optimization

- Optimize your code for performance and efficiency where possible.

#### Version Control

- Maintain a clean and well-documented Git repository with meaningful commit messages and proper branching strategies.
